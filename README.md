### Hey, I'm oversizedcanoe.
---
I'm a Canadian software developer. I like to build simple games, tools, and libraries. I work with C#, Typescript, and SQL day to day but have experience with Python, 
Vanilla Javascript, PHP, HMTL, and CSS.

Some projects/things on my todo list:
- CSV-to-Model tool (C#)
- Mobile app that notifies you every 5 minutes you've used an application
- Refactor the two card games ([ridethebus](https://github.com/oversizedcanoe/ridethebus) and [bigbill](https://github.com/oversizedcanoe/bigbill))
  - I would like to try out React or another JavaScript framework--since the main "logic" of these games are already fleshed out, it'd be a good opportunity to try on these apps.
- Some sort of online arcade, potentially using the two games above, plus others
  - I'd like to take a look at web sockets, to make "rooms"
- I'd like to try out unit testing frameworks as well as speed-testing frameworks--potentially the CSV-to-Model tool would be a good use for this
- I have a Raspberry Pi 4 sitting collecting dust, so using that for some sort of physical motion (some sort of car, robot, etc)
